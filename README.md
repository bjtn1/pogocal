Pogocal is a program written in python that scrapes the website [https://leekduck.com/events/](https://leekduck.com/events/) using a plethora of APIs and adds Pokemon Go events to my Google calendar using the Google Calendar API

# If you want to replicate this for your own time zone, or fo your own calendar...

I did not make this pogram to distibute it -- I made it to share the google calendar.

However, if you wish to re-make this program so that events are added to YOUR personal calendar in YOUR timezone, you're gonna need a few things.

## Requirements for replication...

1. Python 3.11.4 or higher
2. [selenium WebDriver](https://pypi.org/project/selenium/)
3. [beautifulsoup4](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/)
4. A Google account
